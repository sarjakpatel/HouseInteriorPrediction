<h3>h. Purpose and Description of the Project</h3>
House Interior Prediction is one such idea where we need at most in recent times. Now-a-days increase in prices of real-estate and increase in legal issues we are in need of a particular selector to tell whether the interior design is good for the room that or which is selected from internet. To make this solution feasible and simple to use we made this House Interior Prediction. Though we have used multiple powerful machine learning models we actually concentrated on transfer learning. Transfer Learning is an approach to select best of multiple features from different model parallelly training with multiple classifiers and regressors. So, tuning the hyperparameters and fusion the model with tensorflow, keras with data that is loaded using pandas and iterated with numpy gave the best and mostly accurate results. We had put those results into one simple and useful interface using flask and distributed those results using performance matrices and F-1 scores.
